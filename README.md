# Attendance-Management-System

This project is made in Java and used to give attendance by the teacher to the students.

There are two sides in this software:
- Admin
- User

The Admin side can :
- See all the details of the students, teachers, staff, batches and courses.
- Create new batches and courses.
- Add new students, teachers and staff.
- Modify the details of the users.

NOTE: As soon as the teacher or student registers or is added in the software, it creates an username and password on its own which can be used by the respective user to login into their account.

The User side can:
- TEACHER: 1)See their provided details. 
           2)Mark attendance of students in their batch. 
           3)See other students attendance.
         
- Student: 1) See their provided details.
           2) See their attendance on a respective date, overall attendance and their percentage(of being present).
           
 NOTE: The batches when being created should include a teacher and the teacher can only give attendance to students of their batch.
